Typo 5.3
========

Welcome to Typo 5.3.  Typo is a blogging platform, like Movable Type or 
Wordpress, written using Ruby on Rails. This was supposed to be a 2 month minor release, but we went so far that we can't call it this way anymore.


New features since Typo 5.2
===========================

* The main goal for Typo 5.3 was the dynamic permalink scheme, which forced us to completely rewrite our URL generation system and our cache system.

* Feedburner support directly into your admin.

* Semi static caching was buggy, and heavy, so we removed it. Typo now only does static caching. 

* Text filters configuration are now on a per user and on a per article basis. When migrating, all users will be given the blog default's text filter.

* More performance improvement, Typo is really fast now

* Even more SEO capabilities. Tags and categories can be removed from search engines, using noindex, removed from sitemap.xml, and Typo now has a robots.txt editor.

* Old drop down menus were replaced with some fancy calendar like date pickers.

* Notifications for sidebar save and autosave are now done using growler, a nice growl like javascript thing.

* Inline editor switching Ã  la Wordpress. Isn't that one cool?

* Admin can now deactivate users.

How to Install Typo
-------------------

There are two ways to install Typo: automatically, using the new Typo installer, or manually, by downloading the source and building a working Rails environment (database, etc) for it.

New users should use the installer wherever possible because it's substantially easier and less trouble-prone.
